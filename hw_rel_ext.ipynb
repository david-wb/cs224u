    "There are many options, and this could easily grow into a project. Here are a few ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try out different classifier models, from `sklearn` and elsewhere.\n",
    "- Add a feature that indicates the length of the middle.\n",
    "- Augment the bag-of-words representation to include bigrams or trigrams (not just unigrams).\n",
    "- Introduce features based on the entity mentions themselves. <!-- \\[SPOILER: it helps a lot, maybe 4% in F-score. And combines nicely with the directional features.\\] -->\n",
    "- Experiment with features based on the context outside (rather than between) the two entity mentions âÂ that is, the words before the first mention, or after the second.\n",
    "- Try adding features which capture syntactic information, such as the dependency-path features used by Mintz et al. 2009. The [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) toolkit contains a variety of [parsing algorithms](http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.parse.html) that may help.\n",
    "- The bag-of-words representation does not permit generalization across word categories such as names of people, places, or companies. Can we do better using word embeddings such as [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, please provide a brief technical description of your original system, so that the teaching team can gain an understanding of what it does. This will help us to understand your code and analyze all the submissions to identify patterns and strategies. We also ask that you report the best score your system got during development, just to help us understand how systems performed overall."
